## Netlify Deploy Instructions

For the simplest deployment:

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Set the base directory to: `client`
3. Set the build command to: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Set the publish directory to: `dist`

This will properly build and deploy the static site with SPA routing.
