# Quick Fix for Netlify Deployment

I've identified the issue with your Netlify deployment. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

## The Problem

Netlify is having trouble routing your single-page application properly. The "Page not found" error appears because Netlify isn't redirecting all routes to your index.html.

## Steps to Fix It

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard Settings**:
   - Go to your site's Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment
   - Verify your build settings:
     - Base directory: `client`
     - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`

2. **Add `_redirects` File**:
   - Make sure the `client/public/_redirects` file exists with this content:
   ```
   /* /index.html 200
   ```
   - This file is already added to your project

3. **Add Custom Netlify Configuration**:
   - In your site's Netlify dashboard, go to:
   - Deploy settings > Post processing > Asset optimization
   - Disable asset optimization temporarily
   - Then go to Functions > Forms
   - Enable "Redirect All to index.html"

4. **Redeploy Your Site**:
   - Trigger a manual redeploy from the Netlify dashboard
   - This will rebuild your site with the proper configuration

Your site should now work correctly with proper routing for all pages.
